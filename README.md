# Visual Odometry

This notebook contains the following topics:

- Camera Coordinate system
- Projection matrix
- Disparity maps
- Depth map from Stereo Camera
- Depth from poinclouds
- SIFT
- HOG
- RANSAC
- Visual Odometry

The main aim of this project is to calculate the visual odometry. As shown below the images of a car moving are given in the dataset.

Taking this information we have calculated the visual odometry. The black lines indicate the ground truth whereas the red lines indicate the path calculated by us.
